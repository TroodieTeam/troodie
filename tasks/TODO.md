Key themes from user feedback:
- **UX Polish**: Multiple small bugs impacting daily usage (clicks, scrolling, menus)

- **Save/Visit Flow**: Need better context and tracking for saves and visits
- **Onboarding**: iPhone 16 compatibility issues

### Risk Areas
- Activity feed may need significant refactoring
- Data import could be complex depending on external API integrations
- Push notifications require proper infrastructure setup
