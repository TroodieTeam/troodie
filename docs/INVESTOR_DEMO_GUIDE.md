## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If login doesn't work:

- Ensure you type: `TROODIE2025` (all uppercase, no spaces)
- Check that beta gate is enabled in app

### If campaigns don't appear:
- Verify test data is seeded (run setup script if needed)
- Check that campaigns are in "active" status
- Ensure restaurant is claimed and verified

### If creator profile doesn't load:
- Verify creator onboarding was completed
- Check that portfolio images uploaded successfully
- Ensure creator_profiles table has data

### If restaurant claiming doesn't work:
- Make sure you're claiming a test restaurant (check for `.test` domain or test restaurant names)
